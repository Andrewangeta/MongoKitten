# Performance

Currently we're working on testing MongoKitten against all major web languages.
So far we've tested faster against all other tested libraries. You can check it yourself by running [the examples here](https://github.com/OpenKitten/Statistics).

## The difference

From our local tests the following results have come up:

- MongoKitten is 55% faster than the mongo-dart driver
- MongoKitten is 6% faster than the Ruby MongoDB drive
