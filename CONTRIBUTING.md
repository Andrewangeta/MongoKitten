# Contributing

Contributors help keep a project growing and alive!

In a project like this, contributing code can be very intimidating, but that doesn't mean that you can't help!

## Contributing code
The best way to start contributing code is by reading the codebase. One way to approach that is by contributing (inline) documentation for the code at hand.

This way you're reading how the code at hand works and helps future contributors and users understand the code better, too.

## Contributing knowledge
What problems did you experience when you started out using the project?

Someone else will have the same issue, sooner or later. You can write your journey into finding the solution in an article or FAQ.

## Contributing ideas
What is a project without fresh ideas? Some of our ideas might be old or may not cover your user case.

## Contributing time
Many users seek help when using libraries. Just being there to help them out is just as important as contributing code!
